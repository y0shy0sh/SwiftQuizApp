# QuizApp for Swift!
## About:
Here's my take on a modular and easy-to-customize quiz app written in Swift using lists, iteration, and all that fun stuff, ready and ripe to be used in Xcode!
It uses SwiftUI since I find it easier to be able to make changes rather then having to move stuff in a storyboard.
## Anything else?
Not really lmao, it was just me having fun.
I plan on updating this QuizApp as time goes on, theres alot that can and will be done in the future!
